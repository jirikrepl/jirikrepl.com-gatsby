## Hosting on national vs .com domain
First option is to have .com domain and switch between languages. Second option is to have coutry code domain (.cz, sk, ...) for every language.
Is there difference in SERP rankings between those two SEO plans?

Country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) rank better than .com domain in different languages.
